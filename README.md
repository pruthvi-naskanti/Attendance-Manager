## [NOTE]:
This application will be support on Android versions 8.0(Oreo) and above i.e(API level : 26 and above).

## Application Information:
For signing into our application and to check funtionality of our application, we have added a faculty account to our app. Credentials for both ADMIN and FACULTY accounts are 
mentioned below.

### For ADMIN module:
Username : admin
password : admin

### For FACULTY module:
Username : faculty
Password : faculty


## Statement of Purpose:
Our idea is to develop an application where faculty will be able to enter, monitor and manage attendance. This attendance system will be installed on the smartphone of the instructor. We aim to create an interface for the instructor that would require limited input information from the professor for marking the attendance of a class. 

## Issues our application address:
We have seen the process of manual attendance that has been carried out in colleges over the years. As this manual attendance system is not only time consuming but it’s can often result in false attendance marking. Apart from that, Paper and pen-based attendance sheets are difficult to manage. So, here we have proposed an application for attendance management which will be implemented as an android application.

## User Roles:
We will be creating 2 login modules
ADMIN
FACULTY
Admin module: Admin will login with his credentials and add students and faculty of all branches and provides the login credentials to each faculty. He has all the access rights of the application.
Faculty module: In this module faculty will login with the credentials provided by the admin. He has the access rights to view the attendance of the students and mark the attendance based on the date, branch, subject and year.
Sketches of our APP:
Login Screen:
Login screen for users will have two fields (username & password) to enter and button in the below to sign-in.
If a faculty member wants to access the application, administrator of the app will need to add faculty members and provide access.
Apart from the above options, there will be a drop-down list at the top consisting of options (Admin/Faculty). Any user using the application will need to select any of the one options and enter the credentials accordingly.
 
Admin Module Screens

Once an admin sign-in’s to the app, they will be following options:
•	Add Student

And there will an additional option Logout at the bottom of the screen.
 

## Add Student:
Once admin clicks on Add Student option, they will be navigated to a screen where they will be able to fill Student details like (firstname, lastname, contact, Address, Department, Year) and add it to the application. Once a student is added, faculty will be able to see added students in the application and mark them attendance.
 



 ## View Student:
 If admin clicks on View Student option, they will be re-directed to a screen showing them options (select department, select year). Once they click on submit after selecting department and year, student list specific to that particular department and year will be seen.
 








## Attendance per Student:
Admin will be able to see PRESENT count of all the students with number of classes attended.
